Attended a  Workshop on KUMO RFM by Pro Jure . and also  worked as a  Beta Tester  of KUMO RFM  Model  by  Pro. Jure Leskovec, Co-founder of Kumo and Professor at Stanford University.
and also submitted out honest feedback after testing the KUMO RFM .

* And for this work professor jure personally invited me via email for their project KUMO RMF and 
the workkshop was to much informative and its me to determined that how the kumo rmf exactly works . 
* KumoRFM (Relational Foundation Model) is an AI foundation model developed by Kumo.ai that generates accurate predictions directly from structured, multi-table business data (like data warehouses or relational databases) without requiring manual feature engineering or model training .
  
* Key Features and Operation - 
    * Training-Free Predictions: Unlike traditional machine learning, KumoRFM is pre-trained on vast volumes of data and uses in-context learning to adapt to new tasks at inference time, delivering results in seconds. This makes predictive AI accessible without extensive ML expertise or infrastructure.
    * Graph Transformer Architecture: It works by interpreting multi-table databases as temporal, heterogeneous graphs and applying a Graph Transformer architecture to learn relationships and historical patterns within the data.
    * Predictive Query Language (PQL): Users can define prediction problems using PQL, a simple, SQL-like language, or even use natural language prompts, to specify what they want to predict.
    * Versatile Applications: It supports a wide range of tasks, including regression, classification, recommendations (item recommendations, customer churn detection), and fraud identification across various industries (e.g., healthcare, finance).
     * Integration: KumoRFM integrates seamlessly with major data platforms like Snowflake and Databricks, and is available for use with AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
* Benefits -
     *  Speed: Streamlines machine learning workflows, providing predictions up to 20x faster than traditional methods.
     *  Accuracy: Achieves accuracy comparable to or better than state-of-the-art supervised deep learning models.
     *  Efficiency: Eliminates the need for manual feature engineering or maintaining separate, task-specific models, reducing engineering effort significantly.
